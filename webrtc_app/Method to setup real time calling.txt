Awesome progress, Nancy! Here's a **step-by-step guide to get started with Zoiper + Jambonz** for real-time call audio ingestion:

---

### üß∞ **Pre-requisites**

Before diving in, make sure you understand:

* Basics of **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**: it‚Äôs how voice calls are initiated over the internet.
* How a **SIP Client (like Zoiper)** communicates with a **SIP Server (like Jambonz)**.
* Fundamentals of **VoIP**, ports, and WebSockets.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Setup

### **STEP 1: Install Zoiper**

* Download from: [https://www.zoiper.com/en/voip-softphone/download/current](https://www.zoiper.com/en/voip-softphone/download/current)
* Install it on your machine.

---

### **STEP 2: Sign Up on [Jambonz Cloud](https://www.jambonz.org/)**

* Go to [https://www.jambonz.cloud](https://www.jambonz.cloud) and create an account.
* Verify email and log into the Jambonz Dashboard.

---

### **STEP 3: Create a SIP User**

* In Jambonz Dashboard ‚Üí *Accounts* ‚Üí Create a **SIP User** (username/password).
* Example:

  * SIP Username: `testuser`
  * Password: `yourpassword`
* Note the **SIP Domain** (e.g., `xyz.jambonz.cloud`).

---

### **STEP 4: Register SIP User in Zoiper**

* Open Zoiper ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí Add Account
* Choose ‚ÄúSIP‚Äù ‚Üí Enter:

  * Username: `testuser`
  * Password: your password
  * Domain: `xyz.jambonz.cloud`
* Register. If all settings are correct, you‚Äôll see **‚ÄúAccount is ready‚Äù**.

---

### **STEP 5: Add a Carrier or Phone Number**

For full calls:

* You‚Äôll need either:

  * A **SIP Trunk** (like Twilio SIP Trunk or free trunk)
  * Or a **Jambonz-provided demo number**
* This is needed to simulate incoming/outgoing real phone calls.

---

### **STEP 6: Create an Application with Webhook**

* Jambonz lets you handle call flows using Webhooks.
* Point the application to a local endpoint (e.g., `ngrok` tunnel + Flask server).
* Use Webhook to:

  * Receive audio in RTP or WebSocket
  * Forward to your STT pipeline

---

## üéØ Simple Exercises

1. **Exercise 1: SIP Ping Test**

   * Register Zoiper with Jambonz SIP credentials and make a SIP-to-SIP call (Zoiper to another Zoiper using Jambonz).
   * This helps test registration & network config.

2. **Exercise 2: Log Audio**

   * Create a simple HTTP endpoint that logs when a call connects (Webhook from Jambonz).
   * This simulates voice bot call handling.

3. **Exercise 3: Audio Streaming**

   * Set up Jambonz to stream audio to a WebSocket server.
   * Print real-time audio bytes to console.
